## About Phoenix 🕊

<em>This site is basically a store site that has just been established and contains several pages that are made only with two languages HTML and CSS and only very little JavaScript is used in it. 🎭<em/>

## Why was Phoenix created? ❓

<em>I am taking a course at a programming training institute and this project was requested by our mentor to be considered as a work resume for me in the future and a grade will be considered for it. 💻<em/>

## Who built the Phoenix? 🤷‍♂️

<em>Just me! I did Phoenix as an example for my future programming and as a task. 💎<em/>

## What does Phoenix include? 👔

<em>
  Phoenix includes the following:
- BEM Based classes <br/>
- Sass independent style sheets <br/>
- HTML pages with multiple classes <br/>
- CSS pages extracted from Sass <br/>
- Different fonts for different sections <br/>
- Various animations for page elements <br/>
- Mixed the class to perform an iterative process <br/>
- Media rules for responsive HTML pages <br/>
- Some variable constants can be reused without rewriting <br/>
<em/>

## How was the Phoenix made? 🎫

<em>I built Phoenix in two months using only HTML and CSS. It was not an easy task, maybe I did it because we were alone. 🌧 <br/>
But now that the project is over, I feel that having my first personal site is a great achievement that I have achieved. 🥇 <br/>
I am not going to leave this site alone, in the future I will develop it by learning more skills and upgrade it to have more quality. 💹<br/>
